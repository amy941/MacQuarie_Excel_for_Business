### - Spreadsheet Design Principles
- **Accurate, Flexible, Responsive, Easy to Maintain, User Friendly.**
- **Keep raw data separate** to ensure your original input stays intact and don't end up damaging it.
- Consider **leaving at least 2-3 rows at the Top** to later on for advanced filters, summary calc., or headings.
- Important to **keep related data in a continuous table**, if fail to do, it's impossible to use features like Pivot Tables, and subtotalling.
- **Don't put text data in columns** that you later on want to perform calculations.
- **Organize similar info stays together**
- **Don't put any blank rows or columns inside a single data set.**
- **Avoid merge cells.**
- Good practice with raw data is to **put it into a table.** Name a table **"tbl_..."**
- Use **Name Ranges**

### - Calculations
- **Calculations must be auditable and transparent**
- **VLOOKUP limitations**: going to break if columns move around/ not auditable and quite inefficient
- **INDEX MATCH, MONTH, YEAR, DATE**
- **EOMONTH**: End-Of-Month
  * =EOMONTH(B3, **-12**) **+1**--> **-12**: get us the last data in the month 12 months ago, **+1:** get the first date of the following month.
  
- **EDATE**
  
### - Formatting
- **Pivot Tables limitations:** unless they are refreshed, they won't reflect updated data/ serious performance issues occur if the data is too large/ hard to share
- When working with **grouped sheets**, ensure to **ungroup them** as soon as you've finished your task at hand.
  
### - Documentation
- Use standard **naming conventions** for naming everything
- Use **sensible headings** where possible
- Take advantage of **Excel's tools** (data validation, comments..)  

### - Interface & Navigation
