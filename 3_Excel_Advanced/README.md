### - Spreadsheet Design Principles
- **Accurate, Flexible, Responsive, Easy to Maintain, User Friendly.**
- **Keep raw data separate** to ensure your original input stays intact and don't end up damaging it.
- Consider **leaving at least 2-3 rows at the Top** to later on for advanced filters, summary calc., or headings.
- Important to **keep related data in a continuous table**, if fail to do, it's impossible to use features like Pivot Tables, and subtotalling.
- **Don't put text data in columns** that you later on want to perform calculations.
- **Organize similar info stays together**
- **Don't put any blank rows or columns inside a single data set.**
- **Avoid merge cells.**
- Good practice with raw data is to **put it into a table.** Name a table **"tbl_..."**
- Use **Name Ranges**

### - Calculations
- **Calculations must be auditable and transparent**
- **VLOOKUP limitations**: going to break if columns move around/ not auditable and quite inefficient
- **INDEX MATCH, MONTH, YEAR, DATE**
- **EOMONTH**: End-Of-Month
  * =EOMONTH(B3, **-12**) **+1**--> **-12**: get us the last data in the month 12 months ago, **+1:** get the first date of the following month.
  
- **EDATE**
  
### - Formatting
- **Pivot Tables limitations:** unless they are refreshed, they won't reflect updated data/ serious performance issues occur if the data is too large/ hard to share
- When working with **grouped sheets**, ensure to **ungroup them** as soon as you've finished your task at hand.
  
### - Documentation
- Use standard **naming conventions** for naming everything
- Use **sensible headings** where possible
- Take advantage of **Excel's tools** (data validation, comments..)  

### - Interface & Navigation

# WEEK 2
# ðŸ”—Link: [Week 2_folder](https://github.com/amy941/MacQuarie_Excel_for_Business/tree/main/3_Excel_Advanced/Week%202)
### - Tables & Structured Referencing
- =ROWS(Sales)
- **Structured References**:
  * looks like Named Ranges. Inside square brackets [...], we can list parts of the table we want to work with.
  * **"&" symbol** indicates current row --> =SUM(Sales[@[Australia]:[China]])
  * **Use Headers**--> =Sales[[#Headers], [Australia]]
  * are **Mixed Cell References**

- LARGE(array, k) =LARGE(Sales[Australia])

### - Using Functions to Sort Data
- **Link URL into Excel file:** ```Data``` tab--> Get Data--> From Web--> paste URL--> click Go. Pick table--> Import--> Ok
- **Sort data**:
  * use COUNTIFS (=COUNTIFS(rateCodes, "<="&'Current Rates'!D4))
  * INDEX(MATCH(ROW_))
    
  
### - Introduction to Array Formulas
- **CSE formula:** Ctrl+Shift+Enter
- **Multi-cell array formula:** use a single calculation to return multiple results.
  * Start by selecting all the cells we want the answers to go
  * Type "=", then select the first set of values (**the whole array**) we want to multiply
  * Multiply "*"...
  * Ctrl+Shift+Enter

- **Array formula:**
  * Always shows in **curly braces** {_}
    {=C4:C36*H4}
  * cannot delete part of array formula. It can update, but has to be all or nothing.

- **Single Cell formula:** =SUM(H7:H9*I7:I9), then Ctrl+Shift+Enter
- **array constant:** an array of values that you specify they are constant rather than referring to cell references.
  * done by putting the values in curly braces, and separating them with semi-colons
    =LARGE(D4:D36, {1; 2; 3}), then Ctrl+Shift+Enter


### - Working w Array Function (TRANSPOSE)
- **TRANSPOSE function:**
  * Start by selecting all the cells we want the values to go,
  * =TRANSPOSE(select all the values we want to swing thro 90 degree)
  * Ctrl+Shift+Enter

  
### - Solving Problems w Array Formulas
- **If returning ERRORs:** =SUM(**IFNA**(H7:H17*I7:I17, 0))
